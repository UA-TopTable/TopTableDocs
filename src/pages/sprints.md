### Sprint retrospective

| What went well                                              | What could have gone better                                                 | Action items                                                    |

| All tasks and user stories were completed on time.          | The UI is better comparing to previous sprint but customer side should improved to have better UX.                       | Have a comprehensive plan for UI expectations and designs.                            |
| Users stories were merged and tested successfully.          |  S3 Service for images is causing some problems due to the need for role or access token for uploading images. In the Learner lab there is a limitation on role/user creation. | Find a solution for uploading images within Learner Lab limitations or search for alternatives |
| The team communicated effectively and worked well together. | User stories for next sprint should be ready before the sprint review.      |  Populate the backlog while doing the sprint retro or review
